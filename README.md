Hi friends :) My name is Elijah Journey Fullerton, I am a rising Senior at Columbia studying Information Science and Intelligent Systems. I spend most of my time studying since I'm a total square []. Nowadays I mostly study Chinese (I take four hour classes through Tsinghua University every weeknight + at least 2 hours of homework on a good day), Machine Learning because its super fun and cool, Algorithm Analysis because math is cool (even though its very painful), and Leetcode because who doesn't need to Leetcode?

On the weekends my girlfriend usually forces me to leave my little STEM-Gremlin cave of an apartment to do "fun things." We are living in Philadelphia this summer (highly recommend) so we like to explore the city. So far we've gone kayaking, hiking, visited museums, and appreciated ~historical sites~.

In more ideal situations, namely non-pandemic situations, I love to travel. My favorite city is Beijing (我的朋友们对我开玩笑因为我有北京口音，但是北京人觉得我说的很棒) and my least favorit country to visit is Poland (Seriously, don't go. Food is bad, weather is bad, history is sad.) I'm excited to work with all of you on this project and have high hopes that our end product(s) will be very professional quality!

My name is Darian. I'm a rising junior at Columbia College, majoring in financial economics and concentrating in statistics. When I have time, I enjoy watching movies. Two of my all time favorites are Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Afterlife (1997). Personally, I don't have much of a coding background, so I'm excited to develop new skills and learn from everyone. I've been slowly working on my own video game.

What's up guys my name is Mohammed Sameer-Uddin but everybody just calls me Sameer. I am currently a rising senior studying Computer Science at Lehman College while being apart of the Macaulay Honors Program. Some of my favorite hobbies currently include playing basketball, watching UFC, and playing Valorant. 

I am super stoked to be a part of this data science program because of how intriguing the projects are and how phenomenal the staff and mentors have been thus far. Really looking forward to learn a lot in the next couple of months and hopefully the skills I develop will give me a solid foundation to succeed in anything I choose to do in the future.

Hello Team, my name is Mario. I’m a rising senior at Lehman College, majoring in Computer Science. Apart from being a student I like going to the gym and reading books. The book I’m currently reading right now is Ali: A Life which is an interesting read and something I am learning from. I’m coming from a good programming background in Python but through this internship I’m interested in learning SQL, R and other tools to further my data science skills.
